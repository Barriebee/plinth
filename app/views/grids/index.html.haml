  This grid system is built to be flexible but still simple enough to read. 
  It can scale up and down, it can fold up and it can be pushed around.
  
  This is only one rule to using this grid system. Try and keep it as *simple as possible*. 
  Rather than creating a 16 column grid, maybe thing about a 4 or 8 coumn grid and nest the element that need it.
  
  Make it only as flexible as it needs be else it will quickly become a pain to maintain.

  Whilst there are defaults set for the grid system, grids should be set per-project.
  The grids are set within the `application.css.scss` file of the project and should be defined before 
  importing any styles.

  ##### Defining a Break point

  Breakpoints must be defined as [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) variables and should be of the following format:

:coderay
  #!SCSS
    $[name]: '[prefix]', [columns], [gutter(px)], '[min/max]', [size(px)]
:markdown
  The smallest break point for this site is defined as:

:coderay
  #!SCSS
     $sister: 'sister-', 4, 15px, "min", 655px;
:markdown
  **NB.** As the grids are designed mobile first, the smallest (screen size) breakpoint should not have a media query set.

  ##### Setting the break points
  
  Once all breakpoints are defined they should be added to the `$grids` variable. The following is the 
  grid settings block from this site:
:coderay
  #!SCSS
  // Set maximum container width for site
  $container-width: 800px;

  $baby: 'baby-', 2, 10px;
  $sister: 'sister-', 4, 15px, "min", 655px;
  $mother: 'mother-', 8, 20px, "min", $container-width;
  
  // Declare grid
  $grids : $baby, $sister, $mother;
-# 

:markdown
  ##### Setting Maximum Width

  To set the maximum width of the container you should set the variable, `$container-width`.

:coderay
  #!SCSS
  $container-width: 800px;

  This grid is using the example setting above and also the same grids that are used on this site.
